# Study Notes for TCP/IP Protocols
This repository contains my study notes for learning TCP/IP protocols. The notes are based on KTH's course [EP1220 Internetworking](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/EP2120?l=en), and include some pictures in the course slides and the text book. </br>
The text book is: Behrouz A. Forouzan, TCP/IP Protocol Suite, 3nd Edition, 2005
